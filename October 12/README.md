Challenges:

Firstly, balancing the speed of both wheels is hard when the weight is built upon the robot. The two wheels don't work in the same way when same power is applied. We have to give different voltages to each wheel so that they can move in the same speed to allow the robot to move straightly forward and backward.


Controlling the robot is really hard even though we built it ourselves.
