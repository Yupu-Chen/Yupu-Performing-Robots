As the previsou reading, *Robots: Asleep, Awake, Alone, and in Love*, this article also argues that performing robots are ideal laboratories for Human-Robot Interaction. Specifically, in the context of this article, they can serve as "testbeds for the development and evaluation of action coordination in robotics" as human beings respond to timing and action coordination sensitively. Using two principles in the acting theory, this article suggests two directions to the development of interactive robots: countinuity and responsiveness.

The discussion in this article is very human-centric. As we discussed in class, should we treat robots as a new independent species? This article seems to suggest that robots should align with human's principles even if the aim is to develop autonomous robots. In order to evaluate the performing robots and further Human-Robot Interaction, the article employs the human acting principles based on the human's sensitivity to timing and fluent coordination. 

Here are some questions I am considering when reading this article:

* While this article is also suggesting that performing robots are good experiments for the development of further Human-Robot Interaction, what about other interactive robots besides theater or musical performing robots as examined in the article? 
* Are they also supposed to comply with some of the human's principles? 
* Will they perform better if they only follow the rules of machines? 
* Will people be satisfied if they do not follow human's principles or preferences?
