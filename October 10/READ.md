Inside Out!!

Doesn’t really matter if we make the exact characters, since we can come up with different emotions

Possible Story Ideas
Robot begins with no emotions, gradually develops new emotions with interactions with humans
A student is working on a robot, encountering different frustrations -> different emotions(sad/anger/frustrated/inspired/… ) -> workout (happy)



Details

Do You Wanna Build a Robot?
Emotions (6 total): Anger, Anxiety (and/or Fear?), Sadness, Joy, Inspiration(?), Surprise, Appreciation (lob<3), Doubt
To emphasize change of emotions, have a small pause between them

Additional Ideas:
Divide into different days - different emotions for different days
Put sheet over robot, walk off stage, take a lap, start “next” day
Humans don’t talk - robots do the talking?

Points of Discussion:
How will the conversations between emotions happen? Will they “possess” the student? Or will there be a separate conversation between them?

An Outline
1. Student comes in with a half-built robot
2. Narration to give more context of what’s going on
3. Anxiety robot comes (stressing about deadline and subject)
4. Anger comes in (starts complaining and getting angry about how professors always seem to make all the deadlines on the same weekend and how nothing is working and how there’s so much to do but for some reason everything is happening at the same time and there’s no time but there are people who want you to spend more time on things that you don’t have time for)
5. Begin working on the robot??
6. Test the robot, goes in a circle
7. Sadness: little time left and feels that the work will never get done
8. Works on the robot more
9. Test the robot, doesn’t move (somehow made it worse???)
10. Doubt? Sadness? Student just lays down on the floor and stops living moving and goes lowkey insane :)
11. Hope goes c’mon we got this, then the emotions start arguing amongst themselves and we get the wheeeeeeeeeee moment where the human goes out of control
12. Student screams “STOP” and says we need to take this step by step, student starts working again with all the emotions
Maybe little tidbit conversations between emotions as they diss work with each other
13. The final test, it works and everyone celebrates lol
